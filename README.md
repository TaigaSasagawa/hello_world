Just for training how to use GitHub

I'm a student of graduated school in University of Tsukuba in japan.
My major is environmental sciences, but recently, I'm interested in basic science like Mathemathics, Phisics, and Biology.
Anyway, my research topic is remote sensig by artificial satellite. I'm trying to classify tree species in Japan from satellite image data by using Mathine Learning.

Thank you for reading.
